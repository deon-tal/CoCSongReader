# CoCSongReader

## Synopsis
This project houses a simple Swing application intended to open a PowerPoint presentation of a song (see .pptx examples in root directory of the project).  
It then determines the number of verses in the song (presentation) and allows you to select which verses you would like to use. The app 
takes the selected verses and puts them into a new presentation.
